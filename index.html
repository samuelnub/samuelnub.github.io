            Hi, I don't really know what on Earth I'm doing, but somehow, someone is seeing this... Uh, so that's something. Here's how
            to do The Sponge: Well uh, take your leg, stick it in the air. Good, now take the other one and jam it right up there. Yep, that's it.
            Then twist yourself around, and do a great big lunge. Congrats, you're doing - The Sponge.
